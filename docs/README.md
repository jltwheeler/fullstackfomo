# FullStackFOMO Docs

This is where all docs for `FullStackFOMO` will be living. I will also be using
this space to document:

- [Cloud architecture][architecture]
- General project architecture and design decisions
- Overall planning and decisions such as data sources that will provide

# Overview

## Context

- Web app that consolidates various full stack tech data sources into an
  overarching platform that is updated in near-real-time
- _**Opinionated**_ - only want the platform to track the _best_ resources to
  remove the amount of noise I usually find on the internet.
- Streamed feed design, twitter-like
- Searchable - _**'I want to find out how to make a graphql api with node.js?'**_
- Data sources include twitter, reddit, blogs, podcasts, youtube videos

## Why?

- On a daily basis I go onto twitter, reddit, blog pages etc. to check for
  updates about the web dev industry
- Having all the info consolidated onto 1 overarching platform will make life
  easier for myself and hopefully other devs too
- Want to only be updated on things happening from the 'greats' in the community
  & filter out the noise from the hundreds of thousands articles / blogs etc.
  being published daily.

## Data Sources

For the MVP, I will **ONLY** be looking at `Data Sources` that have accessible
`APIs`. No web scraping of data will be undertaken as of yet.

Data sources for MVP include:

- Twitter
- Reddit
- Youtube
